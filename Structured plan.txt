Week 1: Foundations & Recursion

Goal: Master recursion patterns and start thinking recursively.

Topics & Activities:

Recursion Basics:

Factorials, Fibonacci, sum of array, string reversals.

Backtracking Basics:

Subsets, permutations, combinations.

LeetCode Practice (Easy → Medium):

Pascal’s Triangle

Generate Parentheses

Subsets

Permutations

Tips:

Focus on writing recursive solutions first.

Draw recursion trees to understand function calls.

Week 2: Linked Lists & Trees

Goal: Understand recursive structures in data structures.

Topics & Activities:

Linked List Recursion:

Reverse a linked list, detect cycles.

Binary Trees Recursion:

Traversals: preorder, inorder, postorder (both recursive & iterative).

Height of a tree, max path sum.

LeetCode Practice (Medium):

Maximum Depth of Binary Tree

Symmetric Tree

Linked List Cycle II

Tips:

Recursion is natural in trees; try solving iteratively afterwards for practice.

Week 3: Backtracking & DFS

Goal: Solve combinatorial problems and graph-like DFS problems.

Topics & Activities:

Backtracking Problems:

N-Queens, combination sum, word search.

DFS on Graphs / Grids:

Flood fill, number of islands.

LeetCode Practice:

Combination Sum

Word Search

Number of Islands

Tips:

Focus on recognizing patterns: recursion + branching.

Week 4: Dynamic Programming (DP)

Goal: Learn to transform recursion into DP for efficiency.

Topics & Activities:

Recursion → DP:

Fibonacci with memoization.

Climbing stairs, minimum path sum.

LeetCode Practice:

Climbing Stairs

Minimum Path Sum

Coin Change

Tips:

Always start with the recursive solution.

Then add memoization or bottom-up DP.

Optional Weeks 5–6: Advanced Patterns

Goal: Solve complex problems combining recursion, DP, and trees/graphs.

LeetCode Focus Areas:

Sliding window, two pointers, binary search on answers.

Medium → Hard problems in:

Trees: Binary Tree Maximum Path Sum

DP: Longest Increasing Subsequence

Graphs: Course Schedule

Extra Tips for Structured Learning

Journal Your Progress: Keep a notebook for patterns learned.

Time Yourself: Aim to solve each problem in ~30–60 minutes.

Learn Patterns, Not Just Solutions: Many problems share templates.

Review & Refactor: After solving, optimize for time and memory.

If you want, I can make a ready-to-follow LeetCode calendar with exact daily problems for 4 weeks. It would tell you what to solve each day, so you don’t have to choose randomly.

Do you want me to do that?
